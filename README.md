## Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the DSA Repository ðŸŽ‰
This repo is a collaborative effort where we solve Data Structures & Algorithms problems in multiple languages. Please follow these rules to keep everything organized.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each problem lives in its own folder, grouped by topic. Inside, we keep language-specific subfolders.
